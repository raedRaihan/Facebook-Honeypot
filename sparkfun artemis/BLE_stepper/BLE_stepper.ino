  basically do whatever you want with this code.

  This example demonstrates basic BLE server (peripheral) functionality for the Apollo3 boards.

  How to use this example:
    - Install the nRF Connect app on your mobile device (must support BLE bluetooth)
    - Make sure you select the correct board definition from Tools-->Board 
      (it is used to determine which pin controls the LED)
    - Compile and upload the example to your board with the Arduino "Upload" button
    - In the nRF Connect app look for the device in the "scan" tab. 
        (By default it is called "Artemis BLE" but you can change that below)
    - Once the device is found click "connect"
    - The GATT server will load with 5 services:
      - Generic Access
      - Generic Attribute
      - Link Loss
      - Immediate Alert
      - Tx Power
    - For this example we've hooked into the 'Immediate Alert' service. 
        You can click on that pane and it will expand to show an "upload"  button.
        Use the upload button to write one of three values (0x00, 0x01, or 0x02)
    - When you send '0x00' (aka 'No alert') the LED will be set to off
    - When you send either '0x01' or '0x02' the LED will be set to on
